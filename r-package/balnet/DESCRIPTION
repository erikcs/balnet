Title: Pathwise Estimation of Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores
Version: 0.0.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Erik", "Sverdrup", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "erik.sverdrup@monash.edu")
    )
Description: Provides pathwise estimation of regularized logistic propensity score models
    using covariate balancing loss functions rather than maximum likelihood.
    Regularization paths are fit via the 'adelie' elastic-net solver with an
    interface inspired by 'glmnet', and objectives that directly target covariate
    balance for the ATE and ATT.
